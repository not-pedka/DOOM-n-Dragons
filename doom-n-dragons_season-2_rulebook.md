## 1 Game mechanics

The game operates in two primary states: **adventuring** and **combat**. At any given time, gameplay can only occur in one of these states.

### 1-1 Adventuring state

**Adventuring** occurs when the characters explore and interact with the game world freely. Players may take their turns in any order; however, the DM[^1] may designate a specific player to act when necessary. Participants should be prepared for occasional interruptions, as these are a natural part of the gameplay experience.

Performing certain actions requires proficiency in the adventure stats[^2]. In order to perform such action, the player has to roll a D20 and compare the result to the action’s check value, with success determined if the roll meets or exceeds the required value. A critical success occurs if the player rolls a natural[^3] 20, automatically succeeding with potentially enhanced results. A critical failure occurs if the player rolls a natural 1, resulting in an automatic failure, often with unintended consequences. 

While adventuring, resources such as HP cannot be depleted. Characters can die though, e.g. if they jump off a cliff or something.

### 1-2 Combat state

#### 1-2-1 Structure

**Combat** is a phase in the game where players take turns to perform actions like attacking. It’s typically initiated when a character interacts with a hostile entity while adventuring.

Unlike adventuring, the state of combat is structured. The environment that has previously surrounded the participants disappears. The game takes form of a traditional turn-based battle system, similar to the in the Final Fantasy series, where your position is irrelevant.

Each player takes actions in a specific order, that's determined before the battle begins. To join the queue, the player must roll a D20 before entering the battle. The higher the roll, the sooner their turn will come. The order persists until the end of the battle.

#### 1-2-2 Actions

The participant has three kinds of actions to choose from: **ATK**, **DEF** and **RST**. Both ATK and DEF moves come in two variants, basic and special. Basic moves cost no SP unlike the special ones.

**The ATK moves** are used to deal damage. In order to perform an attack, the die that belongs to it must be rolled. The roll is the raw amount that would be substracted from the target's HP after performing the move. The value may be influenced by the affinity of the attack - if the affinity aligns with the target's vulnerability, it will be increased by 2, and if it aligns with the resistance, the damage will be decreased.

**The DEF moves** are are used to prevent taking damage. The basic DEF move is the same on most characters - use it to mitigate damage based on the roll. Special DEF moves are usually utilized by the support type classes.

**The RST move** is the same and universal for all characters. It let's to skip a turn in exchange for SP. The gain is equivalent to a roll of a D4+2[^4] die.

Additionally, each character can make use of a **passive skill**. It's a skill that doesn't require any actionss to be used and works as the name suggests, passively.

## 3 Story
to be written

[^1]: The DOOM Master (DM) is the storyteller and referee who creates the world, controls NPCs, and guides the game’s events. They shape the adventure and respond to players' actions.

[^2]: Adventure stats are the stats that correspond to roll bonus when performing actions while adventuring. The stats are:

      - MD
        - "_the soul's control unit_"
        - Mind; gives intelligence, insight, investigation resistance to mind control and similar effects.
      - BD
        - "_a vessel for a soul_"
        - Body; gives strength, durability, athletics, acrobatics, stealth, resistance to bleed and similar effects.
      - SL
        - "..."
        - Soul; a utility stat that's used where the previous two don't fit, e.g. perception, deception, etc. 

	When creating a character, the player must allocate the stats in such way that their sum is equal to 0. -5 and +5 are the minimum and maximum values each stat can have.

[^3]: A natural roll is a result of a die roll that is not influenced by any modifiers or penalties.

[^4]: A modulated die is a die that has a suffix attatched to it. The result of such a die roll is the outcome of an expression formed by the combination of the die roll result and the suffix. For example, let's say that we want to roll a D6×3 die. We roll a D6 and then multiply the result by 3, because it's in the suffix.
